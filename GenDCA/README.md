The source code of general DCA.

Operat the experiment by 

```
python3 GenDCA Ns bytei Nt c
```
to recovery the bytei-th byte of the secret key.
Ns is the slot number in the attacked dummy shufling, Nt is the trace number and c is the threshold value,
Suggested Nt and c can be computed from __SuccessRate.py__.
The time complexity will return and it is ignored the time complexity in generating trace.
